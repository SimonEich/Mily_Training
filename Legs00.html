      <h1>Thoughts on Leg day</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Here I want to share some thougts, why I chose this excercise and why I've putted
    them in this order.</p>
    <p>I started with the in my opinion havienst excercise and go to the more and more easy.</p>
    <p>All the excercise hiting the Legs, but they have the focus in diffret parts. Some are more for the front, back, side or booty.</p>
    <p>The Wall-Sit in the end is to get at least at one point to the point of failure. </p>
    <p>It's important to adjust the Reps to the level. The program is just for the start. There are more difficult and effectiv excercise.</p>
